# Rabe_py

This is a rust/python implementation of rabe, covering keygeneration, encryption and decryption. Rabe is a rust library implementing several Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) schemes using a modified version of the `bn` library of zcash (type-3 pairing / Baretto Naering curve). The modification of `bn` brings in `serde` or `borsh` instead of the deprecated `rustc_serialize`.
